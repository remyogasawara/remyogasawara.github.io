I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, working with Dr. Jeff Phillips. I am interested in data-driven machine learning and explainable AI. Currently, I am working on a project on mechanistic interpretability that uses steering vectors to control the behaviors and attitudes of LLMs. I am supported by the NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship.
